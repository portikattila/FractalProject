Title: Multi-fractal Analysis of the Julia Set and the Quasi-Julia Set

This project draws inspiration from my PhD research, which partly focuses on studying the dynamical system associated with a special class of non-linear quantum protocols. The time evolution induced by such a protocol can be mathematically described using an iterated function system. Determining the outcome of the protocol involves calculating the attractive points and their corresponding attraction regions within the dynamical systems. For pure initial states, the border of these attraction basins forms the Julia set, which may exhibit a highly intricate structureâ€”a fractal embedded in a two-dimensional space. Conversely, in the case of arbitrary initial states, the set of boundary points, termed the quasi-Julia set, represents a fractal embedded within a three-dimensional space. The primary objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive numerical analysis of both the Julia set and the quasi-Julia set across a diverse range of protocols within the aforementioned family. Through examining their fractal properties, I aim to elucidate the underlying dynamics and gain deeper insights into the behavior of these systems. Specifically, I aim to determine the multifractal spectra of these sets using the box-counting method and interpret the outcomes. The behavior of the generalized dimension can reveal the potential scaling rules of fractals, thereby discerning whether the studied sets are truly multifractals or monofractals.
